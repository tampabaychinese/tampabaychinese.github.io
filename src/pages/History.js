            The Chinese Fellowship began its Sunday Service at Seminole First
            Baptist Church in March 1993. In January 2000, it became an
            independent church and changed its name to Tampabay Chinese Baptist
            Church. It also relocated to the First Baptist Church of St.
            Petersburg with the use of its facilities. In July 2008, we moved
            into our own church after the construction was completed.
